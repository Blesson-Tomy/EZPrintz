## Problem Description
Our college has a central printing shop for the more than 2000 students in the campus. We can only access the printing shop during break and lunch times, leading to huge queues that tend to leave students hungry and frustrated since most of us are unable to eat at that time. 

## My Suggested Solution
Therefore, I would like to implement an online form that would collect the required details from the students such that the staff will be able to print the requested documents during lesson time such that students will only need to collect and pay at the shop. This reduces the queue and waiting time by more than 70%. 

Possible Issues:

1. It is possible that students upload confusing instructions
    Solution: Provide options for the students to make it as easy and efficient as possible.

2. Students might not come to collect their order
    Solution: Further orders from their register number will be banned.

3. Students might not know how to use the form
    Solution: Students are free to go down to the printing shop and print themselves.
